# Welcome

![](https://ds3.ai/2022/assets/r.png)

**Welcome to the Intro to R Programming Workshop!**

Link to Slides: <https://favstats.github.io/ds3_r_intro/>

**Workshop description:**

This workshop focuses on the very beginnings of a great journey ahead of
you: learning how to use and be comfortable with the statistical
programming language R. Together we will explore the basics, from the
working environment itself, creating functions for simplifying your
tasks, to data management with the tidyverse package. The overarching
goal of the workshop is for you to receive the necessary skill set that
will enable you to soon embark on your own data science adventures. That
being said, the most important aspect of the workshop will be to have
fun along the way so that your journey can begin as smoothly and easily
as possible.

# R as Calculator

At its core R is just a fancy *calculator*

![](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/math-1963506-1657007.png)

R can do:

-   `+` addition
-   `-` subtraction
-   `*` multiplication
-   `/` division
-   `^` exponentiation

## Try it out

```{r}

15 + 5

```

## Mix operators

```{r}

(15 + 5) / (2 * 5)

```

> Note: when we put a hash tag in front of our code then that is a
> **comment**.

Comments are just a useful way for us to add some text to our code, for
example to explain what we are doing.

```{r}

## I will be ignored
2*2*2
## And so will I

```

## An animal data set appears..

But adding up numbers for no reason is no fun.

That's why we will use a data set about animals to learn some R Basics.

[Animal Ageing and Longevity
Database](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/marketplace/the-animal-aging-and-longevity-database/)
(John Snow Labs)

Data on over 4200 animals.

Information on age of maturity, gestation or incubation periods but also
**longevity (in years)**.

## Animal Lifespan Data

Say you want to know how old an animal is in human years.

We can use the following simple formula to determine that:

$\frac{\text{Maximum lifespan human}}{\text{Maximum lifespan non-human animal}} = \text{animal to human years conversion ratio}$

*Note: This is just a **very rough** way to determine the conversion
ratio. It is much more complicated in
[reality](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-calculate-dog-years-to-human-years/).*

Why are we using longevity instead of.. let's say *average life
expectancy*?

According to the [Animal Ageing and Longevity
Database](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/marketplace/the-animal-aging-and-longevity-database/)
(John Snow Labs):

> "[...] [M]aximum longevity (also called maximum lifespan) [...] is the
> most widely used parameter for comparing the rate of aging between
> species."

First some important data points.

**Human Longevity**

The longest human to ever live is a woman named: [Jeanne
Calment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment). The french woman
reached the age of **122 (!)**. She was born in 1875 and lived until
1997.

**Animal Longevity Stats**

Here is a table of maximum longevity for various animals:

| Animal                | Maximum Longevity (in years) |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Human                 | 122.5                        |
| Domestic dog          | 24.0                         |
| Domestic cat          | 30.0                         |
| American alligator    | 77.0                         |
| Golden hamster        | 3.9                          |
| King penguin          | 26.0                         |
| Lion                  | 27.0                         |
| Greenland shark       | 392.0                        |
| Galapagos tortoise    | 177.0                        |
| African bush elephant | 65.0                         |
| California sea lion   | 35.7                         |
| Fruit fly             | 0.3                          |
| House mouse           | 4.0                          |
| Giraffe               | 39.5                         |
| Wild boar             | 27.0                         |

### Dog to Human years

Calculating the animal to human conversion ratio

```{r}

122.5/24

```

So for every year a human ages, a dog "ages" 5.1 human years.

How old is a 15 year old dog in human years?

```{r}

5.104167*15

```

# R Objects

Now it can be quite tedious to juggle all those numbers around.

Especially if we want to keep reusing numbers we calculated before.

Here to simplify that process are: **R objects**.

You can think of R objects as *saving information*, for example simple
numbers or just plain text.

In fact it is good to remember that:

> $\color{blue}{\text{"Everything that exists in R is an object."}}$
> \~John M. Chambers

By creating an object we *save* the information to our working
environment and we can recall it whenever we want by just running the
name of the object.

We create R objects by using the assignment operator:

> **\<-**

or

> **=**

[tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) recommends to use
**\<-** for assignment so that is what we are going to use here.

Here is an example using the small exercise from earlier:

1.  First, we assign the human max lifespan to a variable called
    `human_lifespan`. The we assign the maximum lifespan of a dog to
    `dog_lifespan`.

```{r}

human_lifespan  <- 122.5
dog_lifespan <- 24

```

If we now run the respective objects we retrieve the saved numbers.

```{r}

human_lifespan

```

```{r}

dog_lifespan

```

Now we can perform the same calculation as before but this time using
objects!

```{r}

dogs_to_human <- human_lifespan / dog_lifespan

```

The variable `dogs_to_human` now holds the dog to human years conversion
ratio.

```{r}

dogs_to_human

```

*Now* we ask again: how old is a 15 year old dog in human years?

```{r}

dogs_to_human*15

```

Same result as earlier!

### Cat to Human years

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWvCwP_XoAIY-S6?format=jpg&name=large){width="169"}

1.  Calculate cats to human years conversion ratio **using objects**
2.  How old is a 15 year old cat in *"human years"*?

```{r}


```

```{r}


```

> Note that object names could be anything here! I chose to go with
> short but self-explanatory names but I could have chosen to just name
> them **`x`**, **`y`** or **`z`**.

## A note on naming stuff

> $$\color{blue}{\text{"There are only two hard things in Computer Science:}}$$
> $$\color{blue}{\text{cache invalidation and naming things. ~ Phil Karlton"}}$$

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ELuERYrU0AAI_7b?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

Artist: [Allison
Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)

There are many approaches to name things in programming.

In this case we will be using a technique called *lower snake case*,
which is also part of the [tidyverse style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html).

Use underscores (`_`) to separate lower case letter words within a name.

Example:

``` markdown
# Recommended
animal_lifespan

# Not recommended
AnimalLifespan
animal.lifespan
```

# Logical Operators

But wait there are more operators! R knows a ton of them.

Logical operators are used for logical tests which can result in either:

$\text{TRUE}$ or $\text{FALSE}$

*(sometimes this is also called a boolean variable)*

Let's first create some more objects to try some logical tests!

```{r}

lion_lifespan <- 27
mouse_lifespan <- 4
fly_lifespan <- 0.3
boar_lifespan <- 27
alligator_lifespan <- 77
greenland_shark_lifespan <- 392
galapagos_tortoise_lifespan <- 177

```

## Equal

**`==`** asks whether two values are the same or equal

```{r}

lion_lifespan == boar_lifespan

```

The code above tests the following statement: \> The lifespan of a lion
equals the lifespan of a boar.

Since both maximum lifespans are `27` this is of course a **`TRUE`**
statement.

## Not Equal

**`!=`** asks whether two values are the not the same or unequal

```{r}

lion_lifespan != boar_lifespan

```

The code above tests the reverse of the above statement: \> The lifespan
of a lion **does not equal** the lifespan of a boar.

Since both maximum lifespans are `27` this is of course a **`FALSE`**
statement.

## Greater or Smaller

We can also test whether certain values are **greater or smaller** than
others:

`>` greater than

```{r}

human_lifespan > fly_lifespan

```

The code above tests the statement: \> The lifespan of a human is
greater than the lifespan of a fly.

Since the maximum human lifespan is `122.5` and a fly does not live
longer than `0.3` years this is of course a **`TRUE`** statement.

```{r}

alligator_lifespan < mouse_lifespan

```

The code above tests the statement: \> The lifespan of an alligator is
smaller than the lifespan of a mouse.

Since the maximum alligator lifespan is `77` and a mouse lives for `4`
years maximum, this is of course a **`FALSE`** statement.

Also note the following options:

-   `>=` greater or equals
-   `<=` smaller or equals

```{r}

20 >= 20

```

# Combine Logical Operators

We can also combine logical tests by testing multiple statements at the
same time:

-   `&` stands for "and" (unsurprisingly)
-   `|` stands for "or"

For example both `alligator_lifespan` and `fly_lifespan` have to be
greater than `mouse_lifespan` for the code below to evaluate as `TRUE`.

```{r}

alligator_lifespan > mouse_lifespan & fly_lifespan > mouse_lifespan

```

If we say `|` (= or) instead, it means either statement evaluation to
`TRUE` is enough!

```{r}

alligator_lifespan > mouse_lifespan | fly_lifespan > mouse_lifespan

```

# Vectors

Now we learned about objects. But so far they have only ever held a
single numeric value.

R is of course much more powerful than that and objects can hold any
number and types of data.

Now we will take a look at **vectors**, or objects that include more
than one value.

You can simply imagine vectors as a list of values. They can consist of
numbers but also strings (or: text).

In order to create a vector in R we make use of `c()` (which stands for
concatenate)

```{r}

c(1, 2, 3, 4)

```

We can combine the lifespans we assigned into objects earlier:

```{r}

c(greenland_shark_lifespan, dog_lifespan, 
  galapagos_tortoise_lifespan,
  mouse_lifespan, fly_lifespan,
  lion_lifespan, boar_lifespan,
  alligator_lifespan, human_lifespan)

```

We can also create a vector of strings by using quotes:

```{r}

c("greenland_shark", "dog", 
  "galapagos_tortoise", "mouse", 
  "fly", "lion", "boar",
  "alligator", "human")

```

Of course we can also assign these vectors to objects.

Let's say we have a vector `animal_lifespans` with different life spans
of animals.

```{r}

animal_lifespans <- c(greenland_shark_lifespan, dog_lifespan, 
  galapagos_tortoise_lifespan,
  mouse_lifespan, fly_lifespan,
  lion_lifespan, boar_lifespan, 
  alligator_lifespan, human_lifespan)

```

Now if we wanted to get the different year conversation ratios we can
simply divide the maximum human age number by the vector.

```{r}

human_lifespan/animal_lifespans

```

Notice how the operation is performed for each item separately and the
result is yet another vector.

```{r}

animal_to_human_ratios <- human_lifespan/animal_lifespans

```

We can also use logical operators with vectors:

```{r}

animal_to_human_ratios < 1

```

Again, notice how the operation is performed for each item separately
and the result is yet another vector, this time consisting of `TRUE` and
`FALSE`.

## Small note on Variable Types

There are four main types of variables:

-   **logical**: Boolean/binary, is either `TRUE` or `FALSE`

```{r}

class(TRUE)

```

-   **character (or string)**: simple text, including symbols and
    numbers `"text"`

```{r}

class("I am a character")

```

-   **numeric**: Numbers. Mathmatical operators can be used here.

```{r}

class(2020)

```

-   **factor**: characters or strings but ordered in some way

```{r}

class(as.factor(c("I", "am", "a", "factor")))

```

Another important value to know is `NA`. It stands for "Not Available"
and simply denotes a *missing value*.

There also more like dates and datetimes but we won't focus on that now.

```{r}

c(NA, 1, 2, NA)

```

## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`

An incredibly useful operator for vectors is **`%in%`**.

The operator checks whether multiple elements occur somewhere in your
vectors.

This basic usage looks like this:

$\color{red}{\text{vector1}}$ %in% $\color{orange}{\text{vector2}}$

Let's first create a vector called `animals` which includes all the
animals in the same

```{r}

animals <- c("greenland_shark", "dog", 
  "galapagos_tortoise", "mouse", 
  "fly", "lion", "boar",
  "alligator", "human")

```

Let's say we want to check whether `giraffe`, `greenland_shark` or
`lion` occur in `animals`.

If we use `|` we would have to write something like this:

```{r}

animals == "giraffe" | animals == "greenland_shark"  | animals == "lion"

```

With `%in%` we can simply pass a vector like this:

```{r}

animals_to_check <-  c("giraffe", "greenland_shark", "lion")
animals %in% animals_to_check

```

Where (if at all) does `greenlands_shark` or `giraffe` occur within our
`animals` vector?

```{r}

animals %in%  c("greenland_shark", "giraffe") 

```

> This might not look too important of an improvement. But what if we
> had dozens or hundreds of animals to check?

```{r}

animals == "honey_bee" | animals == "cardiocondyla_obscurior" | animals == "black_garden_ant" | animals == "pheidole_dentata" | animals == "squinting_bush_brown" | animals == "american_lobster" | animals == "firebelly_toad" | animals == "oriental_firebelly_toad" | animals == "yellow_bellied_toad" | animals == "greenland_shark" | animals == "western_toad" | animals == "yosemite_toad" | animals == "great_plains_toad" | animals == "green_toad" | animals == "canadian_toad" | animals == "red_spotted_toad" | animals == "sonoran_green_toad" | animals == "southern_toad" | animals == "veragoa_stubfoot_toad" | animals == "common_european_toad" | animals == "colorado_river_toad" | animals == "kihansi_spray_toad" | animals == "ridge_headed_toad" | animals == "cuban_toad" | animals == "european_green_toad" | animals == "colombian_giant_toad" | animals == "argentine_toad" | animals == "cane_toad" | animals == "eurura_toad" | animals == "common_horned_frog" | animals == "colombian_horned_frog" | animals == "amazonian_horned_frog" | animals == "ornate_horned_frog" | animals == "green_and_black_dart_poison_frog" 

```

With **`%in%`** it's much more readable:

```{r}

animals_to_check <-  c("honey_bee", "cardiocondyla_obscurior", "black_garden_ant", "pheidole_dentata", "squinting_bush_brown", "american_lobster", "firebelly_toad", "oriental_firebelly_toad", "yellow_bellied_toad",  "greenland_shark", "western_toad", "yosemite_toad", "great_plains_toad", "green_toad", "canadian_toad", "red_spotted_toad", "sonoran_green_toad", "southern_toad", "veragoa_stubfoot_toad", "common_european_toad",  "colorado_river_toad", "kihansi_spray_toad", "ridge_headed_toad", "cuban_toad", "european_green_toad","colombian_giant_toad", "argentine_toad", "cane_toad", "eurura_toad", "common_horned_frog", "colombian_horned_frog", "amazonian_horned_frog", "ornate_horned_frog")

```

```{r}

animals %in% animals_to_check

```

# Indexing

Indexing is done via square brackets `[]` for when you want to know a
specific value within your object.

> $$\color{red}{\text{vector}}[\color{orange}{\text{elements}}]$$

Exracting the first element of a vector:

```{r}

animal_lifespans[1]

```

```{r}

animals[1]

```

Exracting the fifth element of a vector:

```{r}

animal_lifespans[5]

```

```{r}

animals[5]

```

```{r}

animals[c(1, 3, 5)]

```

## Indexing with logical tests

You can also index using logical tests.

So if an expression evaluates to `TRUE` it will **keep** that element
and when it evaluates to `FALSE` it will remove the **element**.

> $$\color{red}{\text{vector}}[\color{orange}{\text{vector of TRUE/FALSE of same length}}]$$

Let's first take a look at a logical test that extracts all animals that
have greater lifespans than humans:

```{r}

animal_lifespans > human_lifespan

```

Now we can use square brackets to only keep those animals that have
greater lifespans than humans.

```{r}

animals[animal_lifespans > human_lifespan]

```

# Functions

> $\color{blue}{\text{"Everything that happens in R is a function."}}$
> \~John M. Chambers

You can think of functions as little machines that (in most cases)
process some **input** and create an **output**.

Input is everything that goes *into* a function:

-   **arguments** you can think of as (pre-determined) input types like
    a lever or numpad.

-   **values** you can think of as the various settings that the levers
    or numpads can have.

> $$\text{function_name}(\color{orange}{\text{argument}}=\color{lightblue}{\text{value}})$$

## The Star Producer

Let's consider the following function (that does not exist
unfortunately): A `star_producer`!

This little machine creates tiny hand-drawn stars depending on some
input. It takes two arguments:

-   `how_many` tells the machine how many stars to produce
-   `type` tells the machine how the stars should look like (in this
    case the machine only supports `"squiggly"` stars but it could be
    upgraded in the future when we learn how to create our own functions
    later on)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/hertieschool_datasciencesummerschool/master/img/starproducer2.png)

> Note: just like levers or numpads you also have to be careful what
> value type an argument expects. You can't type numbers into a lever
> and a numpad doesn't do much when you pull it (other than break).
> Similarly, a certain argument might require you to input a numeric
> value, or more complex R objects.

## Get `?help`

But how do you know which function takes what kind of values?

You can find the documentation of a function when you type in
`?function_name`. This should tell you about the arguments, how to use
the function and what to expect from its output.

## Example function: seq

Let's try this with a function that is included in every fresh R
installation: `seq`.

```{r, eval = F}

?seq

```

From the description we can learn that this function is used to

> "[g]enerate regular sequences".

Its first three arguments are this:

-   `from`, `to`: the starting and (maximal) end values of the sequence.

-   `by`: number: increment of the sequence.

So we specify from when to where our sequence should go and by which
number it should increment.

Let's first take a look at this within our machine allegory.

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/hertieschool_datasciencesummerschool/master/img/seq2.png)

If we would want to create a vector from 1 to 10 that increments by 1 we
can simple specify the following input values for the arguments:

-   `from`: 1
-   `to`: 10
-   `by`: 1

This is how that looks like in code:

```{r}

seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)

```

### Passing Values

Now there are two ways to pass values to functions in R:

1.  Pass by argument *names* (we already did this above!)
2.  Pass by argument *position*

In the former case, we specifically mention which arguments we want to
pass our values to.

For that, it doesn't matter in which **order** we pass our arguments.

So this is perfectly valid code that produces the same result as above
even if it seems less intuitive:

```{r}

seq(to = 10, by = 1, from = 1)

```

But: **coders are lazy**.

There is no need to always specify which argument you mean exactly when
you can just match *by position*.

So our sequence example could just as well look like this:

```{r}

seq(1, 10, 1)

```

And it works because the documentation tells us that the first three
arguments are `from`, `to`, and `by`.

In the future you will see it often that people just leave out the
arguments completely so it's good to get used to it.

## More examples: Mean and Median

In fact, most of the time functions have such intuitive structures that
we often wouldn't need to even look up the documentation (even though
it's advisable to do).

An easy function to use is `mean` which simply calculates the average of
a numeric vectors.

Let's try this with the `animal_lifespans` we created earlier.

```{r}

mean(animal_lifespans)

```

*Quite* old mean value!

```{r}

median(animal_lifespans)

```

Well when we take the median instead of the mean we can see that this is
due to high outliers (the median is of course more robust to extreme
values).

There are of course many more functions in R and we will get to learn
some of them during this workshop.

# Creating our own functions

We can create our own function using the call: `function()`.

We encode what is supposed to happen within curly brackets `{}`.

Here is the anatomy of a function:

$\color{purple}{\text{name}}$ \<-
$\text{function}(\color{orange}{\text{argument}})${

> $\color{green}{\text{# function body}}$

> $\color{lightblue}{\text{value}}$ \<-
> $\color{orange}{\text{argument}}$

> $\text{return(}\color{lightblue}{\text{value}}\text{)}$

}

-   $\color{purple}{\text{Function name}}$:
    -   An identifier by which the function is called
-   $\color{orange}{\text{Argument(s)}}$:
    -   Contains a list of values passed to the function
    -   Can also contain a default value like this: `argument = 1`
-   $\color{green}{\text{Function body}}$:
    -   This is executed each time the function is called
-   $\color{lightblue}{\text{Return value}}$:
    -   Ends function call & sends the value back to the global
        environment

## Square functions

Let's define a function which squares numeric values.

```{r}

square <- function(number_to_be_squared) { 
  
  squared_number <- number_to_be_squared^2

  return(squared_number)                  
  
}

```

```{r}

square(4)

```

> Tip: In RStudio we can just type fun and enter after the popup and
> RStudio will just automatically generate a template for a function.

## Dog to Human years function

Let's create a function that is able to calculate dog years into human
years. We call the function `dog_to_human_years`.

```{r}

dog_to_human_years <- function(animal_years){

  human_lifespan <- 122.5
  dog_lifespan <- 24

  ratio <- human_lifespan/dog_lifespan

  human_years <- animal_years*ratio

  return(human_years)
}

```

```{r}

dog_to_human_years(8)

```

Works perfect!

## A quick note on errors and debugging

So you encountered an error:

```{r, echo = F, message = T}
message("Error: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable")
```

# R as Calculator

![](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/math-1963506-1657007.png)

R can do:

-   `+` addition
-   `-` subtraction
-   `*` multiplication
-   `/` division
-   `^` exponentiation

## Try it out

```{r}

15 + 5

```

## Mix operators

```{r}

(15 + 5) / (2 * 5)

```

> Note: when we put a hash tag in front of our code then that is a
> **comment**.

Comments are just a useful way for us to add some text to our code, for
example to explain what we are doing.

```{r}

## I will be ignored
2*2*2
## And so will I

```

## An animal data set appears..

But adding up numbers for no reason is no fun.

That's why we will use a data set about animals to learn some R Basics.

[Animal Ageing and Longevity
Database](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/marketplace/the-animal-aging-and-longevity-database/)
(John Snow Labs)

Data on over 4200 animals.

Information on age of maturity, gestation or incubation periods but also
**longevity (in years)**.

## Animal Lifespan Data

Say you want to know how old an animal is in human years.

We can use the following simple formula to determine that:

$\frac{\text{Maximum lifespan human}}{\text{Maximum lifespan non-human animal}} = \text{animal to human years conversion ratio}$

*Note: This is just a **very rough** way to determine the conversion
ratio. It is much more complicated in
[reality](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-calculate-dog-years-to-human-years/).*

Why are we using longevity instead of.. let's say *average life
expectancy*?

According to the [Animal Ageing and Longevity
Database](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/marketplace/the-animal-aging-and-longevity-database/)
(John Snow Labs):

> "[...] [M]aximum longevity (also called maximum lifespan) [...] is the
> most widely used parameter for comparing the rate of aging between
> species."

First some important data points.

**Human Longevity**

The longest human to ever live is a woman named: [Jeanne
Calment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment). The french woman
reached the age of **122 (!)**. She was born in 1875 and lived until
1997.

**Animal Longevity Stats**

Here is a table of maximum longevity for various animals:

| Animal                | Maximum Longevity (in years) |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Human                 | 122.5                        |
| Domestic dog          | 24.0                         |
| Domestic cat          | 30.0                         |
| American alligator    | 77.0                         |

| Greenland shark       | 392.0                        |
| Galapagos tortoise    | 177.0                        |
| African bush elephant | 65.0                         |
| California sea lion   | 35.7                         |
| Fruit fly             | 0.3                          |

### Dog to Human years

Calculating the animal to human conversion ratio

```{r}

122.5/24

```

So for every year a human ages, a dog "ages" 5.1 human years.

How old is a 15 year old dog in human years?

```{r}

5.104167*15

```

# R Objects

Now it can be quite tedious to juggle all those numbers around.

Especially if we want to keep reusing numbers we calculated before.

Here to simplify that process are: **R objects**.

You can think of R objects as *saving information*, for example simple
numbers or just plain text.

In fact it is good to remember that:

> $\color{blue}{\text{"Everything that exists in R is an object."}}$
> \~John M. Chambers

By creating an object we *save* the information to our working
environment and we can recall it whenever we want by just running the
name of the object.

We create R objects by using the assignment operator:

> **\<-**

or

> **=**

[tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) recommends to use
**\<-** for assignment so that is what we are going to use here.

Here is an example using the small exercise from earlier:

1.  First, we assign the human max lifespan to a variable called
    `human_lifespan`. The we assign the maximum lifespan of a dog to
    `dog_lifespan`.

```{r}

human_lifespan  <- 122.5
dog_lifespan <- 24

```

If we now run the respective objects we retrieve the saved numbers.

```{r}

human_lifespan

```

```{r}

dog_lifespan

```

Now we can perform the same calculation as before but this time using
objects!

```{r}

dogs_to_human <- human_lifespan / dog_lifespan

```

The variable `dogs_to_human` now holds the dog to human years conversion
ratio.

```{r}

dogs_to_human

```

*Now* we ask again: how old is a 15 year old dog in human years?

```{r}

dogs_to_human*15

```

Same result as earlier!

### Cat to Human years

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FWvCwP_XoAIY-S6?format=jpg&name=large){width="169"}

1.  Calculate cats to human years conversion ratio **using objects**
2.  How old is a 15 year old cat in *"human years"*?

```{r}


```

```{r}


```

> Note that object names could be anything here! I chose to go with
> short but self-explanatory names but I could have chosen to just name
> them **`x`**, **`y`** or **`z`**.

## A note on naming stuff

> $$\color{blue}{\text{"There are only two hard things in Computer Science:}}$$
> $$\color{blue}{\text{cache invalidation and naming things. ~ Phil Karlton"}}$$

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ELuERYrU0AAI_7b?format=jpg&name=4096x4096)

Artist: [Allison
Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)

There are many approaches to name things in programming.

In this case we will be using a technique called *lower snake case*,
which is also part of the [tidyverse style
guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html).

Use underscores (`_`) to separate lower case letter words within a name.

Example:

``` markdown
# Recommended
animal_lifespan

# Not recommended
AnimalLifespan
animal.lifespan
```

# Logical Operators

But wait there are more operators! R knows a ton of them.

Logical operators are used for logical tests which can result in either:

$\text{TRUE}$ or $\text{FALSE}$

*(sometimes this is also called a boolean variable)*

Let's first create some more objects to try some logical tests!

```{r}

lion_lifespan <- 27
mouse_lifespan <- 4
fly_lifespan <- 0.3
boar_lifespan <- 27
alligator_lifespan <- 77
greenland_shark_lifespan <- 392
galapagos_tortoise_lifespan <- 177

```

## Equal

**`==`** asks whether two values are the same or equal

```{r}

lion_lifespan == boar_lifespan

```

The code above tests the following statement: \> The lifespan of a lion
equals the lifespan of a boar.

Since both maximum lifespans are `27` this is of course a **`TRUE`**
statement.

## Not Equal

**`!=`** asks whether two values are the not the same or unequal

```{r}

lion_lifespan != boar_lifespan

```

The code above tests the reverse of the above statement: \> The lifespan
of a lion **does not equal** the lifespan of a boar.

Since both maximum lifespans are `27` this is of course a **`FALSE`**
statement.

## Greater or Smaller

We can also test whether certain values are **greater or smaller** than
others:

`>` greater than

```{r}

human_lifespan > fly_lifespan

```

The code above tests the statement: \> The lifespan of a human is
greater than the lifespan of a fly.

Since the maximum human lifespan is `122.5` and a fly does not live
longer than `0.3` years this is of course a **`TRUE`** statement.

```{r}

alligator_lifespan < mouse_lifespan

```

The code above tests the statement: \> The lifespan of an alligator is
smaller than the lifespan of a mouse.

Since the maximum alligator lifespan is `77` and a mouse lives for `4`
years maximum, this is of course a **`FALSE`** statement.

Also note the following options:

-   `>=` greater or equals
-   `<=` smaller or equals

```{r}

20 >= 20

```

# Combine Logical Operators

We can also combine logical tests by testing multiple statements at the
same time:

-   `&` stands for "and" (unsurprisingly)
-   `|` stands for "or"

For example both `alligator_lifespan` and `fly_lifespan` have to be
greater than `mouse_lifespan` for the code below to evaluate as `TRUE`.

```{r}

alligator_lifespan > mouse_lifespan & fly_lifespan > mouse_lifespan

```

If we say `|` (= or) instead, it means either statement evaluation to
`TRUE` is enough!

```{r}

alligator_lifespan > mouse_lifespan | fly_lifespan > mouse_lifespan

```

# Vectors

Now we learned about objects. But so far they have only ever held a
single numeric value.

R is of course much more powerful than that and objects can hold any
number and types of data.

Now we will take a look at **vectors**, or objects that include more
than one value.

You can simply imagine vectors as a list of values. They can consist of
numbers but also strings (or: text).

In order to create a vector in R we make use of `c()` (which stands for
concatenate)

```{r}

c(1, 2, 3, 4)

```

We can combine the lifespans we assigned into objects earlier:

```{r}

c(greenland_shark_lifespan, dog_lifespan, 
  galapagos_tortoise_lifespan,
  mouse_lifespan, fly_lifespan,
  lion_lifespan, boar_lifespan,
  alligator_lifespan, human_lifespan)

```

We can also create a vector of strings by using quotes:

```{r}

c("greenland_shark", "dog", 
  "galapagos_tortoise", "mouse", 
  "fly", "lion", "boar",
  "alligator", "human")

```

Of course we can also assign these vectors to objects.

Let's say we have a vector `animal_lifespans` with different life spans
of animals.

```{r}

animal_lifespans <- c(greenland_shark_lifespan, dog_lifespan, 
  galapagos_tortoise_lifespan,
  mouse_lifespan, fly_lifespan,
  lion_lifespan, boar_lifespan, 
  alligator_lifespan, human_lifespan)

```

Now if we wanted to get the different year conversation ratios we can
simply divide the maximum human age number by the vector.

```{r}

human_lifespan/animal_lifespans

```

Notice how the operation is performed for each item separately and the
result is yet another vector.

```{r}

animal_to_human_ratios <- human_lifespan/animal_lifespans

```

We can also use logical operators with vectors:

```{r}

animal_to_human_ratios < 1

```

Again, notice how the operation is performed for each item separately
and the result is yet another vector, this time consisting of `TRUE` and
`FALSE`.

## Small note on Variable Types

There are four main types of variables:

-   **logical**: Boolean/binary, is either `TRUE` or `FALSE`

```{r}

class(TRUE)

```

-   **character (or string)**: simple text, including symbols and
    numbers `"text"`

```{r}

class("I am a character")

```

-   **numeric**: Numbers. Mathmatical operators can be used here.

```{r}

class(2020)

```

-   **factor**: characters or strings but ordered in some way

```{r}

class(as.factor(c("I", "am", "a", "factor")))

```

Another important value to know is `NA`. It stands for "Not Available"
and simply denotes a *missing value*.

There also more like dates and datetimes but we won't focus on that now.

```{r}

c(NA, 1, 2, NA)

```

## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`

An incredibly useful operator for vectors is **`%in%`**.

The operator checks whether multiple elements occur somewhere in your
vectors.

This basic usage looks like this:

$\color{red}{\text{vector1}}$ %in% $\color{orange}{\text{vector2}}$

Let's first create a vector called `animals` which includes all the
animals in the same

```{r}

animals <- c("greenland_shark", "dog", 
  "galapagos_tortoise", "mouse", 
  "fly", "lion", "boar",
  "alligator", "human")

```

Let's say we want to check whether `giraffe`, `greenland_shark` or
`lion` occur in `animals`.

If we use `|` we would have to write something like this:

```{r}

animals == "giraffe" | animals == "greenland_shark"  | animals == "lion"

```

With `%in%` we can simply pass a vector like this:

```{r}

animals_to_check <-  c("giraffe", "greenland_shark", "lion")
animals %in% animals_to_check

```

Where (if at all) does `greenlands_shark` or `giraffe` occur within our
`animals` vector?

```{r}

animals %in%  c("greenland_shark", "giraffe") 

```

> This might not look too important of an improvement. But what if we
> had dozens or hundreds of animals to check?

```{r}

animals == "honey_bee" | animals == "cardiocondyla_obscurior" | animals == "black_garden_ant" | animals == "pheidole_dentata" | animals == "squinting_bush_brown" | animals == "american_lobster" | animals == "firebelly_toad" | animals == "oriental_firebelly_toad" | animals == "yellow_bellied_toad" | animals == "greenland_shark" | animals == "western_toad" | animals == "yosemite_toad" | animals == "great_plains_toad" | animals == "green_toad" | animals == "canadian_toad" | animals == "red_spotted_toad" | animals == "sonoran_green_toad" | animals == "southern_toad" | animals == "veragoa_stubfoot_toad" | animals == "common_european_toad" | animals == "colorado_river_toad" | animals == "kihansi_spray_toad" | animals == "ridge_headed_toad" | animals == "cuban_toad" | animals == "european_green_toad" | animals == "colombian_giant_toad" | animals == "argentine_toad" | animals == "cane_toad" | animals == "eurura_toad" | animals == "common_horned_frog" | animals == "colombian_horned_frog" | animals == "amazonian_horned_frog" | animals == "ornate_horned_frog" | animals == "green_and_black_dart_poison_frog" 

```

With **`%in%`** it's much more readable:

```{r}

animals_to_check <-  c("honey_bee", "cardiocondyla_obscurior", "black_garden_ant", "pheidole_dentata", "squinting_bush_brown", "american_lobster", "firebelly_toad", "oriental_firebelly_toad", "yellow_bellied_toad",  "greenland_shark", "western_toad", "yosemite_toad", "great_plains_toad", "green_toad", "canadian_toad", "red_spotted_toad", "sonoran_green_toad", "southern_toad", "veragoa_stubfoot_toad", "common_european_toad",  "colorado_river_toad", "kihansi_spray_toad", "ridge_headed_toad", "cuban_toad", "european_green_toad","colombian_giant_toad", "argentine_toad", "cane_toad", "eurura_toad", "common_horned_frog", "colombian_horned_frog", "amazonian_horned_frog", "ornate_horned_frog")

```

```{r}

animals %in% animals_to_check

```

# Indexing

Indexing is done via square brackets `[]` for when you want to know a
specific value within your object.

> $$\color{red}{\text{vector}}[\color{orange}{\text{elements}}]$$

Exracting the first element of a vector:

```{r}

animal_lifespans[1]

```

```{r}

animals[1]

```

Exracting the fifth element of a vector:

```{r}

animal_lifespans[5]

```

```{r}

animals[5]

```

```{r}

animals[c(1, 3, 5)]

```

## Indexing with logical tests

You can also index using logical tests.

So if an expression evaluates to `TRUE` it will **keep** that element
and when it evaluates to `FALSE` it will remove the **element**.

> $$\color{red}{\text{vector}}[\color{orange}{\text{vector of TRUE/FALSE of same length}}]$$

Let's first take a look at a logical test that extracts all animals that
have greater lifespans than humans:

```{r}

animal_lifespans > human_lifespan

```

Now we can use square brackets to only keep those animals that have
greater lifespans than humans.

```{r}

animals[animal_lifespans > human_lifespan]

```

# Functions

> $\color{blue}{\text{"Everything that happens in R is a function."}}$
> \~John M. Chambers

You can think of functions as little machines that (in most cases)
process some **input** and create an **output**.

Input is everything that goes *into* a function:

-   **arguments** you can think of as (pre-determined) input types like
    a lever or numpad.

-   **values** you can think of as the various settings that the levers
    or numpads can have.

> $$\text{function_name}(\color{orange}{\text{argument}}=\color{lightblue}{\text{value}})$$

## The Star Producer

Let's consider the following function (that does not exist
unfortunately): A `star_producer`!

This little machine creates tiny hand-drawn stars depending on some
input. It takes two arguments:

-   `how_many` tells the machine how many stars to produce
-   `type` tells the machine how the stars should look like (in this
    case the machine only supports `"squiggly"` stars but it could be
    upgraded in the future when we learn how to create our own functions
    later on)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/hertieschool_datasciencesummerschool/master/img/starproducer2.png)

> Note: just like levers or numpads you also have to be careful what
> value type an argument expects. You can't type numbers into a lever
> and a numpad doesn't do much when you pull it (other than break).
> Similarly, a certain argument might require you to input a numeric
> value, or more complex R objects.

## Get `?help`

But how do you know which function takes what kind of values?

You can find the documentation of a function when you type in
`?function_name`. This should tell you about the arguments, how to use
the function and what to expect from its output.

## Example function: seq

Let's try this with a function that is included in every fresh R
installation: `seq`.

```{r, eval = F}

?seq

```

From the description we can learn that this function is used to

> "[g]enerate regular sequences".

Its first three arguments are this:

-   `from`, `to`: the starting and (maximal) end values of the sequence.

-   `by`: number: increment of the sequence.

So we specify from when to where our sequence should go and by which
number it should increment.

Let's first take a look at this within our machine allegory.

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/hertieschool_datasciencesummerschool/master/img/seq2.png)

If we would want to create a vector from 1 to 10 that increments by 1 we
can simple specify the following input values for the arguments:

-   `from`: 1
-   `to`: 10
-   `by`: 1

This is how that looks like in code:

```{r}

seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)

```

### Passing Values

Now there are two ways to pass values to functions in R:

1.  Pass by argument *names* (we already did this above!)
2.  Pass by argument *position*

In the former case, we specifically mention which arguments we want to
pass our values to.

For that, it doesn't matter in which **order** we pass our arguments.

So this is perfectly valid code that produces the same result as above
even if it seems less intuitive:

```{r}

seq(to = 10, by = 1, from = 1)

```

But: **coders are lazy**.

There is no need to always specify which argument you mean exactly when
you can just match *by position*.

So our sequence example could just as well look like this:

```{r}

seq(1, 10, 1)

```

And it works because the documentation tells us that the first three
arguments are `from`, `to`, and `by`.

In the future you will see it often that people just leave out the
arguments completely so it's good to get used to it.

## More examples: Mean and Median

In fact, most of the time functions have such intuitive structures that
we often wouldn't need to even look up the documentation (even though
it's advisable to do).

An easy function to use is `mean` which simply calculates the average of
a numeric vectors.

Let's try this with the `animal_lifespans` we created earlier.

```{r}

mean(animal_lifespans)

```

*Quite* old mean value!

```{r}

median(animal_lifespans)

```

Well when we take the median instead of the mean we can see that this is
due to high outliers (the median is of course more robust to extreme
values).

There are of course many more functions in R and we will get to learn
some of them during this workshop.

# Creating our own functions

We can create our own function using the call: `function()`.

We encode what is supposed to happen within curly brackets `{}`.

Here is the anatomy of a function:

$\color{purple}{\text{name}}$ \<-
$\text{function}(\color{orange}{\text{argument}})${

> $\color{green}{\text{# function body}}$

> $\color{lightblue}{\text{value}}$ \<-
> $\color{orange}{\text{argument}}$

> $\text{return(}\color{lightblue}{\text{value}}\text{)}$

}

-   $\color{purple}{\text{Function name}}$:
    -   An identifier by which the function is called
-   $\color{orange}{\text{Argument(s)}}$:
    -   Contains a list of values passed to the function
    -   Can also contain a default value like this: `argument = 1`
-   $\color{green}{\text{Function body}}$:
    -   This is executed each time the function is called
-   $\color{lightblue}{\text{Return value}}$:
    -   Ends function call & sends the value back to the global
        environment

## Square functions

Let's define a function which squares numeric values.

```{r}

square <- function(number_to_be_squared) { 
  
  squared_number <- number_to_be_squared^2

  return(squared_number)                  
  
}

```

```{r}

square(4)

```

> Tip: In RStudio we can just type fun and enter after the popup and
> RStudio will just automatically generate a template for a function.

## Dog to Human years function

Let's create a function that is able to calculate dog years into human
years. We call the function `dog_to_human_years`.

```{r}

dog_to_human_years <- function(animal_years){

  human_lifespan <- 122.5
  dog_lifespan <- 24

  ratio <- human_lifespan/dog_lifespan

  human_years <- animal_years*ratio

  return(human_years)
}

```

```{r}

dog_to_human_years(8)

```

Works perfect!

## A quick note on errors and debugging

So you encountered an error:

```{r, echo = F, message = T}
message("Error: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable")
```

Steps to take:

* Try to understand what it says.

* Google (or other search engines)

    + Search for the error
    + Search for what you were trying to do (add R or rstats)

* If the error occurs in a function check whether you passed an object type that isn't expected by it.
    
    + Checking the documentation can help here! Type: `?function`

* Ask for help! Create a *reproducible example* (reprex) and post to online communities
    
    + Stackoverflow
    + Twitter (use #rstats)
    + RStudio community (forum)
