Here you can find the materials for the R Workshop:

Introduction to R Programming.

**Scripts:**

The Workshop was held with Google Colab. Google Colab runs instantaneously runs Jupyter Notebooks in your browser with an R Kernel.

+ Google Colab Links:

    + [Part I (R Basics)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dLsdGbkvgn1JbWgsy9Z-pFmPd_2MG4Xu?usp=sharing)
    + [Part II (Data Manipulation with the `tidyverse`)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14CRElnKewnp5MnlxhqVu6OOcIXd-Bkaj?usp=sharing)
    + [Solutions to the Exercises](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11UXpilfyMAFQtvdMvD7MhS2_XXKvUT9f?usp=sharing)

If you prefer to use RStudio to run the scripts, you have two options:

+ You can find the **raw Rmarkdown files** [here](https://github.com/favstats/ds3_r_intro/tree/main/Rmd) in this Repository. Download them and open them in your local RStudio.

+ Simply start a **Binder** instance which will create a session of RStudio in your Browser (may take a little bit):

   [![Binder](https://binder.pangeo.io/badge_logo.svg)](https://binder.pangeo.io/v2/gh/favstats/ds3_r_intro/rstudio?urlpath=rstudio)
   
 Don't forget to download the files before you close out the session because otherwise anything you added will be lost!

+ If you just want to look a look at the scripts (not interactive) you can check it out here:

    + [Part I (R Basics)](https://favstats.github.io/ds3_r_intro/Rmd/01_rbasics)
    + [Part II (Data Manipulation with the `tidyverse`)](https://favstats.github.io/ds3_r_intro/Rmd/02_datamanipulation)
    + [Solutions to the Exercises](https://favstats.github.io/ds3_r_intro/Rmd/03_solutions)

+ If you prefer the **raw Jupyter Notebooks file**, you can find them [here](https://github.com/favstats/ds3_r_intro/tree/main/jupyter).



The Slides are knitted with the help of the {[xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)} R package and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/favstats/ds3_r_intro/blob/main/index.Rmd).
