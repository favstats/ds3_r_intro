R is a .fancy[statistical] programming language developed for data analysis and visualization.

#### What is <img src="images/rstudio.png" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0"; width="80px"/>?

RStudio is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

* Write, save and open R Code (.R/.Rmd files)

* Provides syntax-highlighting and auto-completion & much more

## Short excourse: a new data set appears..


But adding up numbers for no reason is no fun.

--

That's why we will use a data set about .fancy[animals] to learn some R Basics.

[Animal Ageing and Longevity Database](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/marketplace/the-animal-aging-and-longevity-database/)

Data on over 4200 animals.

Information on age of maturity, gestation or incubation periods but also **longevity (in years)**.

]


---

## Animal Ageing and Longevity Database


Say we want to know how old an animal is in *human years*.

--

We can use the following simple formula to determine that:

<br>

$$\frac{\text{Maximum lifespan human}}{\text{Maximum lifespan non-human animal}} = \text{animal to human years ratio}$$

<br>

*Note: This is just a **very rough** way to determine the conversion ratio. It is **much more** complicated in [reality](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/how-to-calculate-dog-years-to-human-years/).*

### Math Operators


Say we want to know how old a dog is in *human years*.

--

The observed maximum lifespan of a human is 122.5 years. For dogs it is 24.

--

.details[
```{r}
122.5/24
```
]

So for every year a human ages, a dog "ages" 5.1 human years. How old is a 15 year old dog in human years?

.details[
```{r}
5.104167*15
```
]

## So many numbers..


Now it can be quite tedious to juggle all those numbers around. 

Especially if we want to keep reusing numbers we calculated before.

--

Here to simplify that process are:

**Objects**


---

class: inverse, middle, center

# R Basics

### R Objects

---

## R Objects

You can think of R objects as *saving information*, for example simple numbers or just plain text. 

Once saved we can recall it whenever we want by just running the name of the object.

--

> Everything that exists in R is *.red[an object]*. .fifty[~John M. Chambers]

--

We create R objects by using the assignment operator: 

<center>
.large[**`<-`**]
</center>

.right[
.fifty[You can also assign with the **`=`** sign but we will not be using this here.]
]

---

## R Objects

Here is an example:

```{r}
human_lifespan  <- 122.5
dog_lifespan <- 24
```

If we now run the respective objects we retrieve the saved numbers.

.details[
```{r}
human_lifespan
```
]

.details[
```{r}
dog_lifespan
```
]


---


## R Objects


Now we can perform the same calculation as before but this time using objects!

```{r}
dogs_to_human <- human_lifespan / dog_lifespan
```

The object `dogs_to_human` now holds the dog to human years conversion ratio.

--

*Now* we ask again: how old is a 15 year old dog in human years?

.details[
```{r}
dogs_to_human*15
```
]

---

## A quick note on naming things

.leftcol[
> Note that object names could be *anything* here!  I could have chosen to just name them `x`, `y` and `z`. 



I typically use lower-case snake case in this style: `animal_rights`.
 
Also recommended by the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html). 
]


.rightcol[
<img src="images/in_that_case.png" style="width: 90%" />

## More operators..

But wait there are more operators: .fancy[logical operators]

--

Logical operators are used for logical tests which can result in either: 

$\text{TRUE}$ or $\text{FALSE}$

*(sometimes this is also called a boolean variable)*

# R Basics

### Logical Operators

---

## Logical Operators

Let's first create some more objects to try some logical tests!

```{r}
lion_lifespan <- 27
mouse_lifespan <- 4
fly_lifespan <- 0.3
boar_lifespan <- 27
alligator_lifespan <- 77
greenland_shark_lifespan <- 392
galapagos_tortoise_lifespan <- 177
```


---

## Logical Operators



`==` asks whether two values are the same or **equal**

The code below tests the following statement: 

*The maximum lifespan of a lion equals that of a boar.*

.details[
```{r}
lion_lifespan == boar_lifespan
```
]

--

Since both maximum lifespans are `27` this is of course a **`TRUE`** statement.

---

## Logical Operators

`!=`  asks whether two values are the *not* the same or **unequal**

The code below tests the following statement: 

*The maximum lifespan of a lion **does not equal** that of a boar.*

.details[
```{r}
lion_lifespan != boar_lifespan
```
]

--

Since both maximum lifespans are `27` (as we saw before) this is of course a **`FALSE`** statement.


---


## Logical Operators

We can also test whether certain values are greater or smaller than others:

`>` greater than

The code below tests the statement: 

*The lifespan of a human is greater than the lifespan of a fly.*

.details[
```{r}
human_lifespan > fly_lifespan
```
]

--

Since the maximum human lifespan is `122.5` and a fly does not live longer than `0.3` years this is of course a **`TRUE`** statement.

---

## Logical Operators


`<` smaller than

The code below tests the statement: 

*The lifespan of an alligator is smaller than the lifespan of a mouse.*

.details[
```{r}
alligator_lifespan < mouse_lifespan
```
]

--

Since the maximum alligator lifespan is `77` and a mouse lives for `4` years maximum, this is of course a **`FALSE`** statement.

--

Also note the following options:

`>=` greater or equals and `<=` smaller or equals

---


## Combine Logical Operators

We can also combine logical tests by testing multiple statements at the same time:

* `&` stands for "and" (unsurprisingly)
* `|` stands for "or"

For example both `alligator_lifespan` and `fly_lifespan` have to be greater than `mouse_lifespan` for the code below to evaluate as `TRUE`.

.details[
```{r}
alligator_lifespan > mouse_lifespan & 
fly_lifespan > mouse_lifespan
```
]



---



## Combine Logical Operators

We can also combine logical tests by testing multiple statements at the same time:

* `&` stands for "and" (unsurprisingly)
* `|` stands for "or"

If we say `|` (= or) instead, it means either statement evaluation to `TRUE` is enough!

.details[
```{r}
alligator_lifespan > mouse_lifespan | 
fly_lifespan > mouse_lifespan
```
]

---


## Even more objects..?

Now we learned about operators and some basic objects. 

But so far objects have only ever held a *single numeric value*. 

R is of course much more powerful than that and objects can hold any number and types of data.

--

Now we will take a look at **vectors**, or objects that include more than one value.

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# R Basics

### Vectors

---

## Vectors

You can simply imagine vectors as a list of values. They can consist of numbers but also *strings* (or: text).

In order to create a vector in R we make use of `c()` (stands for *concatenate*)


.details[
```{r}
c(1, 100, 1000, 2000, 5000)
```
]

We can also create a vector of strings by using quotes:


.details[
```{r}
c("I", "am", "a", "vector", "of", "strings")
```
]

---


## Vectors

We can combine the lifespans we assigned into objects earlier:


```{r}
animal_lifespans <-  c(greenland_shark_lifespan, dog_lifespan, 
  galapagos_tortoise_lifespan,
  mouse_lifespan, fly_lifespan,
  lion_lifespan, boar_lifespan,
  alligator_lifespan, human_lifespan)
```

.details[
```{r}
animal_lifespans
```
]


---


## Vectors

We can also create a vector of strings by using quotes:

.details[
```{r}
animals <- c("greenland_shark", "dog", 
  "galapagos_tortoise", "mouse", 
  "fly", "lion", "boar",
  "alligator", "human")
```
]



.details[
```{r}
animals
```
]


---


## Vectors

Now if we wanted to get the different year conversation ratios we can simply divide the maximum human age number by the vector.

.details[
```{r}
human_lifespan / animal_lifespans
```
]

Notice how the operation is performed for each item separately and the result is yet another vector.


---

## Vectors

We can also use *logical* operators with vectors:

.details[
```{r}
animal_lifespans > human_lifespan
```
]

Again, notice how the operation is performed for each item separately and the result is yet another vector, this time consisting of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s.

---


## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`

An incredibly useful operator for vectors is **`%in%`**. 

The operator checks whether multiple elements occur somewhere in your vectors.

Its basic usage looks like this:

$\color{red}{\text{vector1}}$ %in% $\color{orange}{\text{vector2}}$


---


## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`


Let's say we want to check whether `giraffe`, `greenland_shark` or `lion` occur in `animals`. 

If we use `|` we would have to write something like this:

```{r, eval=F}
animals == "giraffe" | animals == "greenland_shark"  | animals == "lion"
```

--

With `%in%` we can simply pass a vector like this:

```{r, eval=F}
animals_to_check <-  c("giraffe", "greenland_shark", "lion")
animals %in% animals_to_check
```

---

## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`

Doesn't that look much better? 

Now imagine you have dozens or hundreds of animals to check!

---

## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`

With **`|`** it's very repetitive and utter chaos.

.fifty[
```{r}
animals == "honey_bee" | animals == "cardiocondyla_obscurior" | animals == "black_garden_ant" | animals == "pheidole_dentata" | animals == "squinting_bush_brown" | animals == "american_lobster" | animals == "firebelly_toad" | animals == "oriental_firebelly_toad" | animals == "yellow_bellied_toad" | animals == "american_toad" | animals == "western_toad" | animals == "yosemite_toad" | animals == "great_plains_toad" | animals == "green_toad" | animals == "canadian_toad" | animals == "red_spotted_toad" | animals == "sonoran_green_toad" | animals == "southern_toad" | animals == "veragoa_stubfoot_toad" | animals == "common_european_toad" | animals == "colorado_river_toad" | animals == "kihansi_spray_toad" | animals == "ridge_headed_toad" | animals == "cuban_toad" | animals == "european_green_toad" | animals == "colombian_giant_toad" | animals == "argentine_toad" | animals == "cane_toad" | animals == "eurura_toad" | animals == "common_horned_frog" | animals == "colombian_horned_frog" | animals == "amazonian_horned_frog" | animals == "ornate_horned_frog" | animals == "green_and_black_dart_poison_frog" 
```
]

---

## A logical operator for vectors: `%in%`


With **`%in%`** it's much more readable.


.fifty[
```{r}
animals_to_check <-  c("honey_bee", "cardiocondyla_obscurior", "black_garden_ant", "pheidole_dentata", "squinting_bush_brown", "american_lobster", "firebelly_toad", "oriental_firebelly_toad", "yellow_bellied_toad",  "american_toad", "western_toad", "yosemite_toad", "great_plains_toad", "green_toad", "canadian_toad", "red_spotted_toad", "sonoran_green_toad", "southern_toad", "veragoa_stubfoot_toad", "common_european_toad",  "colorado_river_toad", "kihansi_spray_toad", "ridge_headed_toad", "cuban_toad", "european_green_toad","colombian_giant_toad", "argentine_toad", "cane_toad", "eurura_toad", "common_horned_frog", "colombian_horned_frog", "amazonian_horned_frog", "ornate_horned_frog")

```
]


```{r}
animals %in% animals_to_check
```

# R Basics

### Indexing (with vectors)

---


## Indexing

When you want to know a specific value within your object you can use indexing.

Indexing is done via square brackets `[]`.

The basic setup looks like this:

$$\color{red}{\text{vector}}[\color{orange}{\text{elements}}]$$
---


## Indexing

Exracting the first element of a vector:

```{r}
animal_lifespans[1]
```

```{r}
animals[1]
```

---

## Indexing

Exracting the fifth element of a vector:

```{r}
animal_lifespans[5]
```

```{r}
animals[5]
```


---

## Indexing with logical tests

You can also index using logical tests. 

So if an expression evaluates to `TRUE` it will **keep** that element and when it evaluates to `FALSE` it will remove the **element**.

$$\color{red}{\text{vector}}[\color{orange}{\text{vector of TRUE/FALSE of same length}}]$$
---


## Indexing with logical tests

Let's first take a look at a logical test that extracts all animals that have greater lifespans than humans:


```{r}
longer_living <- animal_lifespans > human_lifespan

longer_living
```

Now we can use square brackets to only keep those animals that have greater lifespans than humans.

```{r}
animals[longer_living]
```


---

## Short excourse: variable types

There are three-ish main types of variables:

--

.seventy[
* **logical**: Boolean/binary, is either `TRUE` or `FALSE`
]

```{r}
class(TRUE)
```

.seventy[
* **character (or string)**: simple text, including symbols and numbers `"text"`
]

```{r}
class("I am a character")
```

.seventy[
* **numeric**: Numbers. Mathmatical operators can be used here.
]

```{r}
class(2020)
```

---

## Short excourse: variable types

Another important value to consider is `NA` (*Not Available*).

`NA` is a special value that simply means *missing value*.

```{r}
c(12, NA, 23, 22, NA)
```

# R Basics

### Functions

---

## Functions

> Everything that happens in R is *.red[a function]*. .fifty[~John M. Chambers]

You can think of functions as little machines that (in most cases) process some kind of **input** and create an **output**. 

Input is everything that goes *into* a function:

*   **arguments** you can think of as (pre-determined) input types like a lever or numpad.

*   **values** you can think of as the various settings that the levers or numpads can have.

$$\text{function_name}(\color{orange}{\text{argument}}=\color{lightblue}{\text{value}})$$
---

## Functions

> Everything that happens in R is *.red[a function]*. .fifty[~John M. Chambers]


You can think of functions as little machines that (in most cases) process some kind of **input** and create an **output**. 

Input is everything that goes *into* a function:

*   **arguments** you can think of as (pre-determined) input types like a lever or numpad.

*   **values** you can think of as the various settings that the levers or numpads can have.

*Let's take a look at an example:  the star producer!*

---

```{r, echo = F, out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/hertieschool_datasciencesummerschool/master/img/starproducer2.png")
```


---


## The Star Producer

Let's consider the following function (that does not exist unfortunately):
A `star_producer`!

This little machine creates tiny hand-drawn stars depending on some input. It takes two arguments:

* `how_many` tells the machine how many stars to produce
* `type` tells the machine how the stars should look like (in this case the machine only supports `"squiggly"` stars but it could be upgraded in the future when we learn how to create our own functions later on)

---

## Getting `?help`

How do we know what function takes what kind of arguments?

Within R you can always run the code:

```{r,eval=F}
?function_name
```

And it will open up the *documentation* for the function that will tell you how to use it.

Googling the function (adding R or rstats) will also often bring you to some documentation in most cases!

---

## An example function: `seq`

--

From the help file we can learn that this function is used to 

> "[g]enerate regular sequences".

Its first three arguments are this:

* `from`, `to`: the starting and (maximal) end values of the sequence. 

* `by`: number: increment of the sequence.



Let's first take a look at this within our machine allegory.

---

```{r, echo = F, out.width="90%"}
include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/favstats/hertieschool_datasciencesummerschool/master/img/seq2.png")
```

---

## An example function: `seq`
If we would want to create a vector from 1 to 10 that increments by 1 we can simple specify the following input values for the arguments:

* `from`: 1
* `to`: 10
* `by`: 1


This is how that looks like in code:

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)
```


---

### A tip

There is however a much simpler way to create sequences that increment by one.

Simply use a *`:`* between two numbers and it generates a sequence:

```{r}
1:10
```


```{r}
1000:1010
```

---

### Passing Values

Now there are two ways to pass values to functions in R:

1.   Pass by argument *names* (we already did this!)
2.   Pass by argument *position*

In the former case, we specifically mention which arguments we want to pass our values to. 

For that, it doesn't matter in which **order** we pass our arguments.

```{r}
seq(to = 10, by = 1, from = 1)
```



---


### Passing Values by position

But: **coders are lazy**.

There is no need to always specify which argument you mean exactly when you can just match *by position*.

So our sequence example could just as well look like this:

```{r}
seq(1, 10, 1)
```

And it works because the documentation tells us that the first three arguments are `from`, `to`, and `by`.

In the future you will see it often that people just leave out the arguments completely so it's good to get used to it. 

---

## More examples: Mean and Median

Many functions have so intuitive arguments that we often don't need to even look up the documentation.

An easy function to use is `mean` which simply calculates the average of a numeric vector. 

Let's try this with the `animal_lifespans` vector we created earlier.

```{r}
mean(animal_lifespans)
```

The mean value is quite high!

---

## More examples: Mean and Median

We can also try and take the median value:

```{r}
median(animal_lifespans)
```

When we take the median instead of the mean we can see that this is due to high outliers (the median is of course more robust to extreme values).

There are many more functions in R and we will get to learn some of them during this workshop.

### Creating our own Functions

<center>
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/f74WDV59cP0NArh8gu/giphy.gif" style="width: 50%" />


</center>


---

## Creating our own functions

We can create our own function using the call: `function()`.

We encode what is supposed to happen within curly brackets `{}`.

Here is the anatomy of a function:


$\color{purple}{\text{my_function_name}}$ <- $\text{function}(\color{orange}{\text{argument}})${


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\color{green}{\text{# function body}}$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\color{lightblue}{\text{output}}$ <- $\color{orange}{\text{argument}}$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\text{return(}\color{lightblue}{\text{output}}\text{)}$

}

---

## Creating our own functions

* $\color{purple}{\text{Function name}}$:
  * An identifier by which the function is called 

* $\color{orange}{\text{Argument(s)}}$:
  * Contains a list of values passed to the function
  * Can also contain a default value like this: `argument = 1`

* $\color{green}{\text{Function body}}$:
  * This is executed each time the function is called

* $\color{lightblue}{\text{Return value}}$:
  * Ends function call & sends the value back to the global environment





---


## Creating our own functions

Let's try this basic example:

```{r}
my_function_name <- function(argument){
  # function body
  output <- argument
  return(output)
}
```

```{r}
my_function_name("I am output!")
```

> Tip: In RStudio we can just type `fun` and enter after the popup and RStudio will just automatically generate a template for a function.


---

## Creating our own functions

We can also specify *default values* for our arguments:

```{r}
my_function_name <- function(argument = "I am a default value"){
  # function body
  output <- argument
  return(output)
}
```

```{r}
my_function_name()
```

---

## Creating our own functions

Let's create a slightly more useful function: a function which squares numeric values.

```{r}
square <- function(here_goes_my_number) { 
  output <- here_goes_my_number^2        
  
  return(output)                  
}
```

```{r}
square(2)   
```




---


## Creating our own functions

Let's create a function that is able to calculate dog years into human years. We call the function `dog_to_human_years`.

```{r}
dog_to_human_years <- function(animal_years){

  human_lifespan <- 122.5
  dog_lifespan <- 24

  ratio <- human_lifespan/dog_lifespan

  human_years <- animal_years*ratio

  return(human_years)
}
```

```{r}
dog_to_human_years(15)
```

---

## A quick note on errors and debugging

Soon we will go into exercise mode!

Before that, however, it's important to understand:

> Seasoned R user or complete beginner, **everyone makes mistakes.**
> Encountering errors sometimes is normal.

No R programmer ever just fell from the sky. 

*Debugging* is the process of finding and resolving bugs/problems in code and it **happens all the time**.

---

## A quick note on errors and debugging

So you encountered an error:

```{r, echo = F, message = T}
message("Error: object of type 'closure' is not subsettable")
```

Steps to take:

* Try to understand what it says.

  * Easier said than done, because many R errors are actually quite cryptic unfortunately.

# Data frames

---

## Data frames

Data frames are the main R object that we will be interacting with. In many ways you already know about them too. 

An example for a data frame would be the table from the [Animal Ageing and Longevity Database](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/marketplace/the-animal-aging-and-longevity-database/) we already saw earlier.


| Animal | Maximum Longevity (in years)|
| --- | --- | 
| Human | 122.5.5 | 
| Domestic dog | 24.0 | 
| Domestic cat | 30.0 | 
| American alligator | 77.0 | 






---

## Data frames

To create a data frame from scratch we can simply pass two (same-sized) vectors to the function `data.frame`. 

```{r}
animals_data <- data.frame(animals, animal_lifespans)

animals_data

```



---

## Variable Names

We can also retrieve the variable names of any data frame by passing it to `names()`.

```{r}
names(animals_data)

```



---

## Retrieve variables

If we want to retrieve specific variables from a data frame we can do that via the `$` operator. 

$$\color{red}{\text{dataset}}$\color{orange}{\text{variable_name}}$$


Think of the `$` symbol as a door opener that helps you check what is inside an object.

```{r}
animals_data$animal_lifespans
```


```{r}
animals_data$animals
```

---

## (Re-)Code variables

We can also use the `$` data access to add **new variables**.

In the below case we create a variable called `animal_to_human` which holds all the human to animal years conversions. 

We do that by simply assigning a vector containing that information to `animals_data$animal_to_human` even if that variable doesn't exist yet.

```{r}
animals_data$animal_to_human <- animals_data$animal_lifespans / human_lifespan
```

```{r}
animals_data
```



---


## Indexing

Just as we did before with vectors we can also index data frames with square brackets: `[]`. However, unlike vectors, data frames have **two dimensions**.

So that is why the square brackets in this case take two inputs, separated by a comma:

$$\color{red}{\text{dataset}}[\color{orange}{\text{rows}},\color{lightblue}{\text{columns}}]$$

* The first value after the opening square bracket refers to $\color{orange}{\text{which rows}}$ you want to keep.

* The second value refers to $\color{lightblue}{\text{which columns}}$ you want to keep.

---


## Indexing


So if we only want to keep the first row of the first column of our `animals_data` that is how we would do that:


```{r}
animals_data[1, 1]
```

*If* we want to keep a certain row but all columns we can do this by leaving the *second* value within the square brackets empty.

```{r}
animals_data[1, ]
```

---

## Indexing

*If* we want to keep a certain column but keep all rows we can do this by leaving the *first* value within the square brackets empty.

```{r}
animals_data[, 1]
```

---

## Indexing with logical tests


We can also do more complex indexing by keeping only the rows that fulfill a certain condition. Let's say we only want to keep the rows that contain animals that have longer lifespans than humans.

```{r}
animals_to_check <- animals_data$animal_lifespans > human_lifespan
```

```{r}
animals_data[animals_to_check, ]
```

## R Packages

Packages are at the heart of R: 

* R packages are basically a collection of functions that you load into your working environment.

* They contain code that other R users have prepared for the community.

--

* It's good to know your packages, they can really make your life easier.

* I suggest keeping track of package developments either on Twitter via #rstats



---

## R Packages

You can install packages in R like this using the `install.packages` function:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("janitor")
```

However, installing is not enough. You also need to load the package via `library`.

```{r}
library(janitor)
```

Think of `install.packages` as buying a set of tools (for free!) and `library` as pulling out the tools each time you want to work with them.

## Core principle: tidy data

* Every column is a variable.
* Every row is an observation.
* Every cell is a single value.

We have already seen tidy data:

## Core principle: tidy data

Tidy data has two decisive advantages:

* Consistently prepared data is easier to read, process, load and save.

* Many procedures (or the associated functions) in R require this type of data.

## Installing and loading the tidyverse

First we install the packages of the tidyverse like this:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Then we load them:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

---



## A new dataset appears..

We are going to work with a new data from here on out.

No worries, we will stay within the animal kingdom but we need a dataset that is a little more complex than what we have seen already.

## A new dataset appears..

We are going to work with a new data from here on out.

Meet the Palmer penguins! Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/).

## Palmer Penguins

We could install the R package `palmerpenguins` and then access the data. 

However, we are going to use a different method: directly load a .csv file (comma-separated values) into R from the internet.

We can use the `readr` package which provides many convenient functions to load data into R. Here we need `read_csv`:

```{r}
penguins_raw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/main/inst/extdata/penguins_raw.csv")

```

---


## Palmer Penguins

```{r}
penguins_raw
```

---


## Palmer Penguins

We can also take a look at data set using the `glimpse` function from `dplyr`.

```{r}
glimpse(penguins_raw)
```

### using `janitor`

```

]

`janitor` is not offically part of the tidyverse package compilation but in my view it is incredibly important to know.

Provides some convenient functions for basic cleaning of the data.

Just like any tidverse-style package it fullfills the following criteria for its functions:

> The data is always the first argument.

This helps us to match by position.

---

```

]

One annoyance with the `penguins_raw` data is that it has spaces in the variable names. Urgh! 

R has to put quotes around the variable names that have spaces:

```{r, eval=F}
penguins_raw$`Delta 15 N (o/oo)`
penguins_raw$`Flipper Length (mm)`

```

`janitor` can help with that: 

using a function called `clean_names()`

---


.leftcol75[

.rightcol25[


```{r, echo = F, out.width=100, out.height=120, fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/raw/main/man/figures/logo_small.png")
```

]

`clean_names()` just magically turns all our messy column names into readable lower-case snake case:

```{r}
library(janitor)

penguins_clean <- clean_names(penguins_raw) 

```

That is how the variables look like now:

```{r, eval=F}
penguins_clean$delta_15_n_o_oo
penguins_clean$flipper_length_mm
```


---

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/raw/main/man/figures/logo_small.png")
```

]

Now we have another problem. Not all variables in the `penguins_clean` data set are that useful. 

Some of them are the same across all observations. We don't need those variables, like `region`.

```{r}
table(penguins_clean$region)
```

We can use the base R function `table` to quickly get some tabulations of our variable.

---

knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/raw/main/man/figures/logo_small.png")
```

]

Here to help get rid of these *constant* columns is the function `remove_constant()`.

```{r, message=T}
penguins_clean <- remove_constant(penguins_clean, quiet = F)


```

```{r, echo = F}
message("Removing 2 constant columns of 17 columns total (Removed: region, stage).")
```


When we set `quiet = F` we even get some input as to what exactly was removed. Neat!


Another useful function in `janitor` is `remove_empty()` which removes all rows or columns that just consist of missing values (i.e. `NA`)

Now we are already fairly advanced in our tidying.

But our dataset is still not entirely tidy yet.

Consider the `species` variable:

```{r}
table(penguins_clean$species)
```

---


## `tidyr`




```{r}
table(penguins_clean$species)
```

This variable violates the tidy rule that each cell should include a single value. 

Species hold both the *common name* and the *latin name* of the penguin.

.rightcol25[


```{r, echo = F, out.width=100, out.height=120, fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
```

]

We can use a `tidyr` function called `separate()` to turn this into two variables.

Two arguments are important for that:

+ `sep`: specifies by which character the value should be split
+ `into`: a vector which specifies the resulting new variable names

---


.leftcol75[

.rightcol25[


```{r, echo = F, out.width=100, out.height=120, fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
```

]

In our case we want to split by opening bracket `\\(` and will name our variables `species` and `latin_name`:

```{r}
penguins_clean <- separate(penguins_clean, species, sep = " \\(", into = c("species", "latin_name"))
```

```{r}
penguins_clean
```

]

In our case we want to split by an empty space and an opening bracket ` \\(` and we will name our variables `species` and `latin_name`:

```{r, eval = F}
penguins_clean <- separate(penguins_clean, species, sep = " \\(", into = c("species", "latin_name"))
```

There is a also a function called `unite()` which works in the opposite direction.

```{r, echo = F, out.width=100, out.height=120, fig.align='right'}

Now our data is in tidy format!

We were in luck because the data pretty much already came in a format that was: one observation per row.

But what if that is not the case?

```

]

`tidyr` also comes equipped to deal with data that has more than one observation per row. 

The function to use here is called `pivot_wider`.

Now our `penguin_clean` data is already tidy.

But we can just read in a dataset that isn't:

```{r}
untidy_animals <- read_csv("https://github.com/favstats/ds3_r_intro/blob/main/data/untidy_animals.csv?raw=true")

```

```

]

You may recognize this data from the subsection *Untidy data I*

Now let's use `pivot_wider` to make every row an observation.

We need two main arguments for that:

1. `names_from`: tells the function where the new column names come from
2. `values_from`: tells the function where the values should come from



---


### `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()`


```{r}
tidy_animals <- pivot_wider(untidy_animals, 
                            names_from = Type, 
                            values_from = Value)

tidy_animals
```

]

`pivot_longer` can untidy our data again

The argument `cols = ` tells the function which variables to turn into long format:

```{r}
pivot_longer(tidy_animals, cols = c(lifespan, ratio))
```

#### Recoding with `ifelse`

`ifelse()` is a very useful function that allows to easily recode variables based on logical tests.

It's basic functionality looks like this:

$$\color{red}{\text{ifelse}}(\color{orange}{\text{logical test}},\color{blue}{\text{value if TRUE}}, \color{green}{\text{value if FALSE}})$$

Here is a very basic example:

```{r}
ifelse(1 == 1, "Pick me if test is TRUE", "Pick me if test is FALSE")
```


```{r}
ifelse(1 != 1, "Pick me if test is TRUE", "Pick me if test is FALSE")
```

---

#### Recoding with `ifelse`

Let's use `ifelse` in combination with `mutate`.

Let's create the variable `sex_short` which has a shorter label for sex:

```{r}
pg_new <- mutate(penguins_clean, sex_short = ifelse(sex == "MALE", "m", "f"))

select(pg_new, sex, sex_short)

```

```

]

`case_when` (from the `dplyr` package) is like `ifelse` but allows for much more complex combinations.

The basic setup for a `case_when` call look like this:


case_when(


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\color{orange}{\text{logical test}}$ ~ $\color{blue}{\text{what should happen if TRUE}}$,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\color{orange}{\text{logical test}}$ ~ $\color{blue}{\text{what should happen if TRUE}}$,


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $\color{orange}{\text{logical test}}$ ~ $\color{blue}{\text{what should happen if TRUE}}$,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $TRUE$ ~ $\color{green}{\text{what should happen with everything else}}$,

)

The following code recodes a numeric vector (1 through 50) into three categorical ones:


```{r}
x <- 1:50

case_when(
  x %in% 1:10 ~ "1 through 10",
  x %in% 11:30 ~ "11 through 30",

Let's use `case_when` in combination with `mutate`.

Creating the variable `short_island` which has a shorter label for `island`:

```{r}
pg_new <- mutate(penguins_clean, 
        island_short = case_when(
          island == "Torgersen" ~ "T",
          island == "Biscoe" ~ "B",
          island == "Dream" ~ "D"

First we group `penguins_clean` by `sex`.

```{r}
grouped_by_sex <- group_by(penguins_clean, sex)
```

`summarize` works in a similar way to `mutate`:

`variable_name = some_calculation`

```{r, echo = F, out.width=100, out.height=120, fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
```

]

Now this works but the problem is: we have to write a lot of code that repeats itself!

```{r}
pg
```

## The `%>%` operator

.rightcol25[


```{r, echo = F, out.width=100, out.height=120, fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
```

]

Another (hardly readable) alternative is to *nest all the functions*:

```{r}
rename(mutate(filter(select(penguins_clean, individual_id, island, body_mass_g), island == "Dream"), bodymass_kg = body_mass_g/1000), id = individual_id)

```

```{r, echo = F, out.width=100, out.height=120, fig.align='right'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png")
```

]

*The piping style*: 

Read from top to bottom and from left to right and the `%>%` as "and then".

```{r}
penguins_clean %>% 
  select(individual_id, island, body_mass_g) %>% 
  filter(island == "Dream") %>% 
  mutate(bodymass_kg = body_mass_g/1000) %>% 
  rename(id = individual_id)

```

## Small Note on the Pipe

Since R Version 4.1.0 Base R also provides a pipe.

It looks like this: $|>$

While it shares many similarities with the `%>%` there are also some differences.

It's beyond the scope of this workshop to go over it here but for the sake of simplicity we will stick with the `magrittr` pipe.

## Using RStudio Projects


[RStudio projects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html) make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.
