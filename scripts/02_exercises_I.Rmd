**Now it's your turn to write some R code!**

The following includes a list of exercises that you can complete on your
own.

## Task 1

Take a look at the table below.

Pick three animals from the Animal Lifespan data we haven't talked about
yet.

Assign the lifespan values to **single** objects with appropriate names.

| Animal                | Maximum Longevity (in years) |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Human                 | 122.5.5                      |
| Domestic dog          | 24.0                         |
| Domestic cat          | 30.0                         |
| American alligator    | 77.0                         |
| Golden hamster        | 3.9                          |
| King penguin          | 26.0                         |
| Lion                  | 27.0                         |
| Greenland shark       | 392.0                        |
| Galapagos tortoise    | 177.0                        |
| African bush elephant | 65.0                         |
| California sea lion   | 35.7                         |
| Fruit fly             | 0.3                          |
| House mouse           | 4.0                          |
| Giraffe               | 39.5                         |
| Wild boar             | 27.0                         |

```{r}



```

## Task 2

Create three (different) logical tests which compare the maximum
longevity between your chosen animal lifespans.

Does the output you get make sense?

```{r}



```

```{r}



```

```{r}



```

## Task 3

Create two vectors with the help of `c()`:

1.  strings (i.e. texts) of all the animals you chose
2.  the respective lifespan values (in the same order)

```{r}



```

```{r}



```

## Task 4

Calculate the mean of your lifespan vector.

```{r}



```

## Task 5

5.1 Retrieve the *second* value of the vector that contains your animal
names.

> Tip: Square brackets are your friend.

```{r}



```

5.2 Using code, find out which animals in your lifespans vector have a
maximum longevity of above 25.

> Tip: For an elegant solution you need to use *both* vectors, square
> brackets and a logical test. If you need help revisit [Indexing with
> logical
> tests](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dLsdGbkvgn1JbWgsy9Z-pFmPd_2MG4Xu#scrollTo=5cAxOXBv8KZ6)

```{r}



```

## Task 6

Calculate the animal to human conversion ratios for the animals you've
picked and assign the results to an object.

```{r}



```

## Task 7

Calculate the human years for your picked animals and assume they are
all 5 years old.

```{r}




```

## Task 8

Pick one of the animals you chose and create a function which takes as
input animal years and outputs human years. Test the function and
validate with results from the seventh exercise.

You can name the function in this style:

`[you_animal_name]_to_human_years`

> Tip: If you need help revisit the section [Dog to Human years
> function](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dLsdGbkvgn1JbWgsy9Z-pFmPd_2MG4Xu#scrollTo=wOvZ0HEWjaHQ&line=3&uniqifier=1)

Create the function here:

```{r}




```

Try it out here:

```{r}
