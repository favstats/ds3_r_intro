# Welcome

**Welcome to the *data manipulation part* of the Intro to R Programming
Workshop!**

# Data frames

Data frames are the main R object that we will be interacting with. In
many ways you already know about them too.

An example for a data frame would be the table from the [Animal Ageing
and Longevity
Database](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/marketplace/the-animal-aging-and-longevity-database/)
we already saw earlier.

| Animal                | Maximum Longevity (in years) |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Human                 | 122.5                        |
| Domestic dog          | 24.0                         |
| Domestic cat          | 30.0                         |
| American alligator    | 77.0                         |
| Golden hamster        | 3.9                          |
| King penguin          | 26.0                         |
| Lion                  | 27.0                         |
| Greenland shark       | 392.0                        |
| Galapagos tortoise    | 177.0                        |
| African bush elephant | 65.0                         |
| California sea lion   | 35.7                         |
| Fruit fly             | 0.3                          |
| House mouse           | 4.0                          |
| Giraffe               | 39.5                         |
| Wild boar             | 27.0                         |

```{r}

human_lifespan <- 122.5
dog_lifespan <- 24
lion_lifespan <- 27
mouse_lifespan <- 4
fly_lifespan <- 0.3
boar_lifespan <- 27
alligator_lifespan <- 77
greenland_shark_lifespan <- 392
galapagos_tortoise_lifespan <- 177

animal_lifespans <- c(greenland_shark_lifespan, dog_lifespan, 
  galapagos_tortoise_lifespan,
  mouse_lifespan, fly_lifespan,
  lion_lifespan, boar_lifespan, 
  alligator_lifespan, human_lifespan)

animals <- c("greenland_shark", "dog", 
  "galapagos_tortoise", "mouse", 
  "fly", "lion", "boar",
  "alligator", "human")

```

To create a data frame from scratch we can simply pass two (same-sized)
vectors to the function `data.frame`.

```{r}

data.frame(animals, animal_lifespans)

```

We can also assign data frames.

```{r}

animals_data <- data.frame(animals, animal_lifespans)

animals_data

```

### Data Dimensions

We can use functions to determine the shape of our data.

#### How many columns does the data have?

We can simply use the function `ncol()` to determine the number of
columns.

```{r}

ncol(animals_data)

```

#### How many rows does the data have?

Run `nrow()` to determine the number of rows.

```{r}

nrow(animals_data)

```

#### `dim()`

We can also use `dim()` to get the same information in one call:

```{r}

dim(animals_data)

```

1st value counts the rows, 2nd value counts the columns.

## Variable Names

We can also retrieve the variable names of any data frame by passing it
to `names()`.

```{r}

names(animals_data)

```

## Retrieve variables

If we want to retrieve specific variables from a data frame we can do
that via the `$` operator.

> $$\color{red}{\text{dataset}}$\color{orange}{\text{variable_name}}$$

Think of the `$` symbol as a door opener that helps you check what is
inside an object.

```{r}

animals_data$animal_lifespans

```

```{r}

animals_data$animals

```

## (Re-)Code variables

We can also use the `$` data access to add **new variables**.

In the below case we create a variable called `animal_to_human` which
holds all the human to animal years conversions.

We do that by simply assigning a vector containing that information to
`animals_data$animal_to_human` even if that variable doesn't exist yet.

```{r}

animals_data$animal_to_human <- animals_data$animal_lifespans / human_lifespan

```

```{r}

animals_data

```

## Indexing

Just as we did before with vectors we can also index data frames with
square brackets: `[]`. However, unlike vectors, data frames have **two
dimensions**.

So that is why the square brackets in this case take two inputs,
separated by a comma:

> $$\color{red}{\text{dataset}}[\color{orange}{\text{rows}},\color{lightblue}{\text{columns}}]$$

-   The first value after the opening square bracket refers to
    $\color{orange}{\text{which rows}}$ you want to keep.

-   The second value refers to $\color{lightblue}{\text{which columns}}$
    you want to keep.

So if we only want to keep the first row of the first column of our
`animals_data` that is how we would do that:

```{r}

animals_data[1, 1]

```

*If* we want to keep a certain row but all columns we can do this by
leaving the *second* value within the square brackets empty.

```{r}

animals_data[1, ]

```

The same works for columns but keep all rows.

This actually returns a vector:

```{r}

animals_data[, 1]

```

## Indexing with logical tests

We can also do more complex indexing by keeping only the rows that
fulfill a certain condition. Let's say we only want to keep the rows
that contain animals that have longer lifespans than humans.

```{r}

animals_data$animal_lifespans > human_lifespan

```

```{r}

animals_data[animals_data$animal_lifespans > human_lifespan, ]

```

# R Packages

[![Some amazing R packages: the \`easystats\`
library](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4mDfxSXEAA_kvG.jpg){width="506"}](https://github.com/easystats/easystats)

Packages are at the heart of R:

-   R packages are basically a collection of functions that you load
    into your working environment.

-   They contain code that other R users have prepared for the
    community.

-   It's good to know your packages, they can really make your life
    easier.

-   I suggest keeping track of package developments either on Twitter
    via #rstats

You can install packages in R like this using the `install.packages`
function:

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("janitor")
```

However, installing is not enough. You also need to load the package via
`library`.

```{r}
library(janitor)
```

Think of `install.packages` as buying a set of tools (for free!) and
`library` as pulling out the tools each time you want to work with them.

# The Tidyverse

![](https://predictivehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/tidyverse-default.png)

## What is the `tidyverse`?

The tidyverse describes itself:

> The tidyverse is an opinionated **collection of R packages** designed
> for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy,
> grammar, and data structures.

<img src="https://rstudio-education.github.io/tidyverse-cookbook/images/data-science-workflow.png" width="100%"/>

## Core principle: tidy data

-   Every column is a variable.
-   Every row is an observation.
-   Every cell is a single value.

We have already seen tidy data:

| Animal             | Maximum Lifespan | Animal/Human Years Ratio |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Domestic dog       | 24.0             | 5.10                     |
| Domestic cat       | 30.0             | 4.08                     |
| American alligator | 77.0             | 1.59                     |
| Golden hamster     | 3.9              | 31.41                    |
| King penguin       | 26.0             | 4.71                     |

### Untidy data I

| Animal             | Type     | Value |
|--------------------|----------|-------|
| Domestic dog       | lifespan | 24.0  |
| Domestic dog       | ratio    | 5.10  |
| Domestic cat       | lifespan | 30.0  |
| Domestic cat       | ratio    | 4.08  |
| American alligator | lifespan | 77.0  |
| American alligator | ratio    | 1.59  |
| Golden hamster     | lifespan | 3.9   |
| Golden hamster     | ratio    | 31.41 |
| King penguin       | lifespan | 26.0  |
| King penguin       | ratio    | 4.71  |

The data above has multiple rows with the same observation (animal).

= not tidy

### Untidy data II

| Animal             | Lifespan/Ratio |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Domestic dog       | 24.0 / 5.10    |
| Domestic cat       | 30.0 / 4.08    |
| American alligator | 77.0 / 1.59    |
| Golden hamster     | 3.9 / 31.41    |
| King penguin       | 26.0 / 4.71    |

The data above has multiple variables per column.

= not tidy

Tidy data has two decisive advantages:

-   Consistently prepared data is easier to read, process, load and
    save.

-   Many procedures (or the associated functions) in R require this type
    of data.

## Installing and loading the tidyverse

First we install the packages of the tidyverse like this. In Google
Colab we actually don't need to install the `tidyverse` because it comes
pre-installed!

```{r, eval = F}

install.packages("tidyverse")

```

Then we load them:

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

## A new data set appears..

We are going to work with a new data from here on out.

No worries, we will stay within the animal kingdom but we need a data
set that is a little more complex than what we have seen already.

**Meet the Palmer Station penguins!**

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen
Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php)
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/).

### Palmer Penguins

We could install the R package `palmerpenguins` and then access the
data.

However, we are going to use a different method: directly load a .csv
file (comma-separated values) into R from the internet.

We can use the `readr` package which provides many convenient functions
to load data into R. Here we need `read_csv`:

```{r}

penguins_raw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins_raw.csv")

```

```{r}

penguins_raw

```

### take a `glimpse`

We can also take a look at data set using the `glimpse` function from
`dplyr`.

```{r}

glimpse(penguins_raw)

```

## initial data cleaning using `janitor`

<img src="https://github.com/sfirke/janitor/raw/main/man/figures/logo_small.png" style="width: 20%"/>

`janitor` is not offically part of the tidyverse package compilation but
in my view it is incredibly important to know.

Provides some convenient functions for basic cleaning of the data.

Just like any tidverse-style package it fullfills the following criteria
for its functions:

> The data is always the first argument.

This helps us to match by position.

```{r, eval = F}

install.packages("janitor")

```

```{r}

library(janitor)

```

### `clean_names()`

One annoyance with the `penguins_raw` data is that it has spaces in the
variable names. Urgh!

R has to put quotes around the variable names that have spaces:

```{r}

penguins_raw$`Delta 15 N (o/oo)`
penguins_raw$`Flipper Length (mm)`

```

`janitor` can help with that:

using a function called `clean_names()`

`clean_names()` just magically turns all our messy column names into
readable lower-case snake case:

```{r}

penguins_clean <- clean_names(penguins_raw)

```

That is how the variables look like now:

```{r}

glimpse(penguins_clean)

```

### `remove_constant()`

Now we have another problem. Not all variables in the `penguins_clean`
data set are that useful.

Some of them are the same across all observations. We don't need those
variables, like `region`.

```{r}

table(penguins_clean$region)

```

We can use the base R function `table` to quickly get some tabulations
of our variable.

Here to help get rid of these *constant* columns is the function
`remove_constant()`.

```{r}

penguins_clean <- remove_constant(penguins_clean, quiet = F)

```

When we set `quiet = F` we even get some info about what exactly was
removed. Neat!

Another useful function in `janitor` is `remove_empty()` which removes
all rows or columns that just consist of missing values (i.e. `NA`)

## Data cleaning using `tidyr`

![](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/logo.png)

Now we are already fairly advanced in our tidying.

But our dataset is still not entirely tidy yet.

Consider the `species` variable:

```{r}

table(penguins_clean$species)

```

This variable violates the tidy rule that each cell should include a
single value.

Species hold both the *common name* and the *latin name* of the penguin.

### `separate()`

We can use a `tidyr` function called `separate()` to turn this into two
variables.

Two arguments are important for that:

-   `sep`: specifies by which character the value should be split
-   `into`: a vector which specifies the resulting new variable names

In our case we want to split by an empty space and opening bracket `\\(`
and will name our variables `species` and `latin_name`:

```{r}

penguins_clean <- separate(penguins_clean, species, sep = " \\(", into = c("species", "latin_name"))

```

```{r}

penguins_clean

```

Now there is still a trailing `)` at the end of `latin_name`. We can
remove that using the `stringr` package and more specifically the
`str_remove()` function.

```{r}

penguins_clean$latin_name <- str_remove(penguins_clean$latin_name, "\\)")

```

```{r}

penguins_clean

```

There is a also a function called `unite()` which works in the opposite
direction.

Now our data is in tidy format!

We were in luck because the data pretty much already came in a format
that was: 1 observation per row.

But what if that is not the case?

### `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()`

`tidyr` also comes equipped to deal with data that has more that one
observation per row.

The function to use here is called `pivot_wider`.

Now our `penguin_clean` data is already tidy.

But we can just read in a dataset that isn't:

```{r}

untidy_animals <- read_csv("https://github.com/favstats/ds3_r_intro/blob/main/data/untidy_animals.csv?raw=true")

untidy_animals

```

You may recognize this data from the subsection *Untidy data I*

Now let's use `pivot_wider` to make every row an observation.

We need two main arguments for that:

1.  `names_from`: tells the function where the new column names come
    from
2.  `values_from`: tells the function where the values should come from

```{r}

tidy_animals <- pivot_wider(untidy_animals,  names_from = Type, values_from = Value)
tidy_animals

```

`pivot_longer` can untidy our data again

The argument `cols =` tells the function which variables to turn into
long format:

```{r}

pivot_longer(tidy_animals,  cols = c(lifespan, ratio))

```

## Data manipulation using `dplyr`

![](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/blob/main/rstats-artwork/dplyr_wrangling.png?raw=true)

Artist: [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst)

### `select()`

helps you select variables

![](https://github.com/favstats/ds3_r_intro/blob/main/images/select.png?raw=true)

`select()` is part of the dplyr package and helps you select variables

Remember: with tidyverse-style functions, **data is always the first
argument**.

#### Select variables

Here we only keep `individual_id`, `sex` and `species`.

```{r}

select(penguins_clean, individual_id, sex, species)

```

But `select()` is more powerful than that.

#### Remove variables

We can also **remove** variables with a **`-`** (minus).

Here we remove `individual_id`, `sex` and `species`.

```{r}

select(penguins_clean, -individual_id, -sex, -species)

```

#### Selection helpers

These *selection helpers* match variables according to a given pattern.

`starts_with()`: Starts with a prefix.

`ends_with()`: Ends with a suffix.

`contains()`: Contains a literal string.

`matches()`: Matches a regular expression.

For example: let's keep all variables that start with `s`:

```{r}

select(penguins_clean, starts_with("s"))

```

#### Even more ways to select

Select the first 5 variables:

```{r}

select(penguins_clean, 1:5)

```

Select everything from `individual_id` to `flipper_length_mm`.

```{r}

select(penguins_clean, individual_id:flipper_length_mm)

```

### `filter()`

helps you filter rows

![](https://github.com/favstats/ds3_r_intro/blob/main/images/filter.png?raw=true)

Here we only keep penguins from the Island `Dream`.

```{r}

filter(penguins_clean, island == "Dream")

```

#### `%in%`

Here the **`%in%`** operator can come in handy again if we want to
filter more than one island:

```{r}

islands_to_keep <- c("Dream", "Biscoe")

filter(penguins_clean, island %in% islands_to_keep)

```

### `mutate()`

helps you create variables

![](https://github.com/favstats/ds3_r_intro/blob/main/images/mutate.png?raw=true)

`mutate` will take a statement like this:

`variable_name = some_calculation`

and attach `variable_name` at the *end of the dataset*.

Let's say we want to calculate penguin bodymass in kg rather than gram.

We take the variable `body_mass_g` and divided by `1000`.

```{r}

pg_new <- mutate(penguins_clean, bodymass_kg = body_mass_g/1000)

```

We temporarily assign the dataset to `pg_new` just to check whether it
worked correctly:

```{r}

select(pg_new, bodymass_kg, body_mass_g)

```

#### Recoding with `ifelse`

`ifelse()` is a very useful function that allows to easily recode
variables based on logical tests.

It's basic functionality looks like this:

$$\color{red}{\text{ifelse}}(\color{orange}{\text{logical test}},\color{blue}{\text{what should happen if TRUE}}, \color{green}{\text{what should happen if FALSE}})$$

Here is a very basic example:

```{r}

ifelse(1 == 1, "Pick me if test is TRUE", "Pick me if test is FALSE")

```

```{r}

ifelse(1 != 1, "Pick me if test is TRUE", "Pick me if test is FALSE")

```

Let's use `ifelse` in combination with `mutate`.

Let's create the variable `sex_short` which has a shorter label for sex:

```{r}

pg_new <- mutate(penguins_clean, sex_short = ifelse(sex == "MALE", "m", "f"))

```

We temporarily assign the dataset to `pg_new` just to check whether it
worked correctly:

```{r}

select(pg_new, sex, sex_short)

```

#### Recoding with `case_when`

`case_when` (from the `dplyr` package) is like `ifelse` but allows for
much more complex combinations.

The basic setup for a `case_when` call looks like this:

case_when(

> $\color{orange}{\text{logical test}}$ \~
> $\color{blue}{\text{what should happen if TRUE}}$,

> $\color{orange}{\text{logical test}}$ \~
> $\color{blue}{\text{what should happen if TRUE}}$,

> $\color{orange}{\text{logical test}}$ \~
> $\color{blue}{\text{what should happen if TRUE}}$,

> $TRUE$ \~
> $\color{green}{\text{what should happen with everything else}}$,

)

The following code recodes a numeric vector (1 through 50) into three
categorical ones:

```{r}

x <- c(1:50)

x

```

```{r}

case_when(
  x %in% 1:10 ~ "1 through 10",
  x %in% 11:30 ~ "11 through 30",
  TRUE ~ "above 30"
)

```

Let's use `case_when` in combination with `mutate`.

Creating the variable `short_island` which has a shorter label for
`island`:

```{r}

test <- mutate(penguins_clean, 
        island_short = case_when(
          island == "Torgersen" ~ "T",
          island == "Biscoe" ~ "B",
          island == "Dream" ~ "D"
        ))

```

```{r}

select(test, island, island_short)

```

With `case_when` you can also mix different variables making this a very
powerful tool!

### `rename()`

Just changes the variable name but leaves all else intact:

```{r}

rename(penguins_clean, sample = sample_number)

```

### `arrange()`

You can order your data to show the highest or lowest value first.

Let's order by `flipper_length_mm`.

Lowest first:

```{r}

arrange(penguins_clean, flipper_length_mm)

```

Highest first using `desc()` (for descendant):

```{r}

arrange(penguins_clean, desc(flipper_length_mm))

```

### `group_by()` and `summarize()`

When you want to aggregate your data (by groups)

Sometimes we want to calculate **group statistics**.

In other languages this is often a pain.

With `dplyr` this is fairly easy **and** readable.

Let's calculate the average `culmen_length_mm` for each sex.

*First* we group `penguins_clean` by `sex`.

```{r}

grouped_by_sex <- group_by(penguins_clean, sex)

```

`summarize` works in a similar way to `mutate`:

`variable_name = some_calculation`

```{r}

summarise(grouped_by_sex, avg_culmen_length = mean(culmen_length_mm, na.rm = T))

```

We could also keep the data structure by using `mutate` on a grouped
dataset:

```{r}

mutate(grouped_by_sex, avg_culmen_length = mean(culmen_length_mm, na.rm = T))

```

Once we are done with `group_by` we should **ungroup** our data gain.

```{r}
next_data <- ungroup(grouped_by_sex)
```

### `count()`

Now this is a function that I use all the time.

This function helps you count how often a certain value occur(s) within
variables(s).

Simply specify which variable you want to count.

Let's count how often the species occur.

```{r}

count(penguins_clean, species, sort = T) 

```

The `sort = T` tells the function to sort by the highest occuring
frequency.

### The `%>%` operator

The point of the pipe is to help you write code in a way that is easier
to read and understand.

Let's consider an example with some data manipulation we have done so
far:

```{r}

## first I select variables
pg <- select(penguins_clean, individual_id, island, body_mass_g)

## then I filter to only Dream island
pg <- filter(pg, island == "Dream")

## then I convert body_mass_g to kg
pg <- mutate(pg, bodymass_kg = body_mass_g/1000)

## rename individual id to simply id
pg <- rename(pg, id = individual_id)

```

Now this works but the problem is: we have to write a lot of code that
repeats itself!

```{r}

pg

```

Another alternative is to *nest all the functions*:

```{r}

rename(mutate(filter(select(penguins_clean, individual_id, island, body_mass_g), island == "Dream"), bodymass_kg = body_mass_g/1000), id = individual_id)

```

But that's extremely tough to read and understand!

*The piping style*:

Read from top to bottom and from left to right and the `%>%` as "and
then".

> Data first, data once

```{r}

penguins_clean %>% 
  select(individual_id, island, body_mass_g) %>% 
  filter(island == "Dream") %>% 
  mutate(bodymass_kg = body_mass_g/1000) %>% 
  rename(id = individual_id)

```

#### `group_by()` again

Grouping also become easier using pipes.

Let's try again to calculate the average `culmen_length_mm` for each sex
but this time with pipes.

```{r}

penguins_clean %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(avg_culmen_length = mean(culmen_length_mm , na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup()

```

#### Small Note on the Pipe

Since R Version 4.1.0 Base R also provides a pipe.

It looks like this: $|>$

While it shares many similarities with the `%>%` there are also some
differences.

It's beyond the scope of this workshop to go over it here so for the
sake of simplicity we will stick with the `magrittr` pipe.
